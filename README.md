DESCRIPTION : A simple calculator in Python provides an intuitive way to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This beginner-friendly program emphasizes user interaction, error handling, and modular code design.

Features:
User Interaction:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+): Computes the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Computes the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication (*): Computes the product of two numbers.
Division (/): Computes the quotient of two numbers, with checks to prevent division by zero.
Error Handling:

The program validates user input to ensure only numeric values are processed.
It handles division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message.
Modular Design:

Each arithmetic operation is encapsulated in a separate function, enhancing code readability and reusability.
Implementation:
The main components of the program include:

Function Definitions:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y, or an error message if y is zero.
Main Program Loop:

Prompts the user to choose an operation and input two numbers.
Calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.
Displays the result and asks if the user wants to perform another calculation.
CONCLUSION     :## Conclusion

The simple calculator project in Python provides a foundational understanding of basic programming concepts, including user input handling, arithmetic operations, and error management. By encapsulating operations in functions, the program promotes clean and modular code design. This project is an excellent starting point for beginners to grasp essential programming skills and serves as a stepping stone for more complex applications. Through this exercise, learners gain practical experience in writing efficient, readable, and user-friendly code, laying a strong foundation for further exploration in the world of programming.
